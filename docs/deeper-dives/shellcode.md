# `pkgx` Shellcode

The `pkgx` shellcode is not integrated by default, first study the shellcode
by dumping to your terminal:

```sh
pkgx --shellcode
```

As you can see the shellcode is a handful of shell functions to achieve the
following:

* a handler for `pkgx +pkg`
  * our handler uses pkgx primitives to install and inject the requested pkgs
    into the shell session
* a command not found handler
  * to suggest `pkgx` invocations for commands we support
* Some `_` support prefixed functions for the above
* We add `~/.local/bin` to your `PATH`
  * we configure packages that install things themselves to install things there

* a change directory hook so developer environments can be activated and
  deactivated automatically when you change directories


## Integrating the Shellcode

First dry run the integration:

```sh
pkgx integrate --dry-run
```

Then integrate:

```sh
eval "$(pkgx integrate)"
```


## Deintegrating the Shellcode

If at any point you want to deintegrate the `pkgx` shellcode type:

```sh
pkgx deintegrate
```
